- **AAPL vs MSFT Comparison**: Comprehensive profitability and efficiency analysis
- **Professional Visualizations**: Multi-panel dashboards with seaborn/matplotlib
- **Streamlined Reporting**: Key metrics in tables, detailed data in charts
- **Automated Analysis**: Python scripts for reproducible financial analysis

### 2. **Economic Data Integration**
- **FRED API Integration**: Federal Reserve Economic Data access
- **CPI Analysis**: Consumer Price Index tracking and inflation metrics
- **Sample Data Generation**: Fallback data for testing and demonstration
- **Economic Visualizations**: Professional charts for economic indicators

### 3. **Data Presentation Strategy**
This toolkit shows only the most critical metrics in tables for quick reference, while comprehensive detailed data is presented through professional visualizations. The charts contain all historical trends, detailed comparisons, and granular financial metrics that would otherwise clutter the tables.

### Environment Variables & API Setup:

#### FRED API Key Setup
This project uses the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API for economic indicators. To use real data:

1. **Get a free API key**: Visit https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
2. **Create `.env` file**: Add your API key to a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   FRED_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Install python-dotenv**: `pip install python-dotenv`
4. **Run the analysis**: The script will automatically load your API key

#### Environment Variables:
- `FRED_API_KEY`: Your FRED API key for economic data access
- `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`: Your Alpha Vantage API key for alternative financial data (optional)
- `FMP_API_KEY`: Your Financial Modeling Prep API key for enhanced company data (optional)
- The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git for security

#### Fallback Mode:
If no API key is found, the script will generate realistic sample data for demonstration purposes.
