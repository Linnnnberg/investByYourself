## 🧹 **Recent Cleanup (January 2025)**

### **🗑️ Removed Outdated Documents:**
- ~~`comprehensive_market_data_plan.md`~~ - **DELETED** (superseded by Master Todo)
- ~~`price_data_model_plan.md`~~ - **DELETED** (duplicate content)
- ~~`alpha_vantage_todo.md`~~ - **DELETED** (implementation details, not planning)
- ~~`company_fundamentals_todo.md`~~ - **DELETED** (implementation details, not planning)
- ~~`macro_data_todo.md`~~ - **DELETED** (implementation details, not planning)

### **✅ Why These Were Removed:**
1. **Outdated Plans**: Created in August 2025, superseded by current implementation
2. **Duplicate Content**: Multiple documents covering the same topics
3. **Implementation Details**: TODO lists belong in Master Todo, not separate docs
4. **Strategic Focus**: Consolidated planning into Master Todo for better organization
