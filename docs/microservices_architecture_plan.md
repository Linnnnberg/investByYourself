# 🏗️ Microservices Architecture Plan - InvestByYourself

*Document Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-27*
*Status: Planning Phase*

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the strategic plan to transform the InvestByYourself platform from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture. The transformation aims to improve scalability, maintainability, team autonomy, and system reliability while maintaining the current functionality and performance.

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### **Existing Architecture**
```

│   ├── etl/               # ETL pipeline components
│   ├── analysis/          # Financial analysis tools
│   ├── ui/                # User interface components

- **HTTP status codes** for error handling

#### **Asynchronous Communication**
- **Message queues** (Redis/RabbitMQ) for background tasks
- **Event-driven architecture** for data consistency
- **Pub/Sub pattern** for notifications
- **Dead letter queues** for failed message handling

#### **API Design Standards**
```
/api/v1/
├── /financial-analysis/
│   ├── /ratios/{company_id}
│   ├── /charts/{company_id}
│   └── /metrics/{company_id}
├── /company-analysis/
│   ├── /profiles/{company_id}
│   ├── /screening
│   └── /sector-analysis
├── /portfolio/
│   ├── /portfolios/{portfolio_id}
│   ├── /risk-assessment
│   └── /performance
└── /etl/
    ├── /status
    ├── /collect/{source}
    └── /transform/{job_id}
```

### **Data Management Strategy**

#### **Database per Service**
- **Service Ownership**: Each service owns its data
- **Data Isolation**: Services cannot directly access other services' data
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency through events
- **Migration**: Independent schema evolution

#### **Shared Data**
- **Reference Data**: Common schemas in shared/database
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration service
- **Audit Logs**: Centralized logging and monitoring

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Variables**: Service-specific .env files
- **Centralized Config**: Shared configuration service
- **Secrets Management**: Secure credential handling
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime configuration changes

## 📅 **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Structure (Week 1)**
- [ ] Create new directory structure
- [ ] Set up shared utilities and common code
- [ ] Create service-specific requirements.txt files
- [ ] Set up service-specific Dockerfiles
- [ ] Establish coding standards and patterns

### **Phase 2: Service Extraction (Week 2-3)**
- [ ] Extract ETL service (most mature component)
- [ ] Extract financial analysis service
- [ ] Extract company analysis service
- [ ] Set up inter-service communication
- [ ] Implement basic health checks

### **Phase 3: Infrastructure & Testing (Week 4)**
- [ ] Extract data service
- [ ] Set up API gateway
- [ ] Update docker-compose for microservices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### **Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 5-6)**
- [ ] Load testing and optimization
- [ ] Security review and hardening
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Production deployment

## 🎯 **Key Decisions & Rationale**

### **1. Service Granularity: Medium (Recommended)**

**Decision**: Start with 6-7 services instead of 10+ microservices

**Rationale**:
- **Easier to manage** than over-fragmented services
- **Clear business boundaries** without unnecessary complexity
- **Balanced complexity** - not too monolithic, not too distributed
- **Easier testing** and deployment
- **Better for small-medium teams**

**Future Refinement**:
- Split `financial-analysis-service` into `ratios-service` + `charts-service` if needed
- Split `etl-service` into `collector-service` + `transformer-service` if needed

### **2. API Design: REST APIs (Recommended)**

**Decision**: Use REST APIs instead of GraphQL initially

**Rationale**:
- **Simpler Implementation**: Easier to build and maintain
- **Better Tooling**: More libraries, testing tools, documentation
- **Easier Debugging**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Better Caching**: HTTP caching works out of the box
- **Familiarity**: Most developers know REST well

**Future Considerations**:
- Can add GraphQL layer later if needed
- GraphQL for complex query requirements
- REST for simple CRUD operations

### **3. Communication Patterns: Hybrid Approach**

**Decision**: Use both synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (events) communication

**Rationale**:
- **REST APIs**: For real-time, user-facing requests
- **Event-driven**: For data consistency and background processing
- **Message Queues**: For reliable, asynchronous task processing
- **Flexibility**: Choose best pattern for each use case

## 📊 **Benefits & Value Proposition**

### **Scalability Benefits**
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale financial analysis without scaling ETL
