# 📈 InvestByYourself – Development Plan

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a **personal wealth planning & trading analysis system** that empowers individual investors with professional-grade data, analysis, and portfolio tools.

The system must balance **data reliability, scalability, and usability** while supporting both **local (desktop)** and **web app** deployment options.

## 🏛️ Architecture Decision: Local vs Web App

| Criteria | Local App | Web App |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Data Control** | Full control, self-hosted DB | Cloud DB, easier multi-user |
| **Performance** | Fast for individual user | Scalable for multiple users |
| **Deployment** | Easy for personal use | Centralized deployment, harder devops |
| **Offline Use** | ✅ Possible with SQLite cache | ❌ Mostly online |
| **Collaboration** | ❌ Single user | ✅ Supports multiple users |
| **Security** | User controls their data | Needs proper cloud security |
| **Maintenance** | User updates manually | Easier centralized updates |

**Recommendation:**
- **MVP as a local app** (Streamlit/Dash or Electron + SQLite/Postgres).
- **Future migration to a web app** once you expand features (multi-user, mobile access, SaaS model).

## 📊 Core Modules

### 1. Market Data & Trend Monitoring
- **Inputs**: Macro (FRED), Indices, Company Fundamentals, News/Sentiment
- **Outputs**: Real-time dashboard, alerts (CPI spikes, volatility, yield curve inversion, etc.)
- **Tech**: FRED API, Yahoo Finance/FMP, OpenBB

### 2. Company Fundamentals
- Profiles: Sector, Market Cap, Business Model, Executives
- Financials: Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow
- Ratios: Profitability, Valuation, Liquidity, Growth
- Data Sources: Yahoo Finance, FMP, SEC EDGAR

### 3. Macro Economic Dashboard
- Inflation (CPI, PCE), Employment (Unemployment, Payrolls), Rates (10Y, Fed Funds), GDP
- Visualization: Economic scorecard, trend analysis, correlation heatmaps

### 4. Portfolio Analysis & Risk Tools
- Portfolio holdings, valuation, performance attribution
- Risk metrics (beta, volatility, Sharpe, VaR, drawdowns)
- Scenario testing: “What if CPI spikes?”

### 5. Backtesting & Strategy Testing
- Trading strategy rules (moving averages, mean reversion, factor models)
- Portfolio simulations
- Historical performance reporting

## 🏗️ Technical Infrastructure

### **ETL & Data Pipeline**
- Extract: APIs (Yahoo, Alpha Vantage, FRED, OpenBB)
- Transform: Standardize, validate, enrich (Python + Pandas)
- Load: Database (SQLite/Postgres for local, Postgres/InfluxDB for web)

### **Database Models**
- Tickers, Prices, Security Metrics, Fundamentals, Economic Indicators
- Data Quality Scoring + Multi-source validation
- Cache layer for real-time data

### **Frontend Options**
- **Local App (MVP)**:
  - Python + Streamlit (fast dashboards)
  - SQLite for data storage
- **Web App (Future)**:
  - Backend: FastAPI + Postgres
  - Frontend: React (Next.js) + Tailwind + Charting libs
  - Hosting: Docker + cloud (AWS/GCP/Render)
