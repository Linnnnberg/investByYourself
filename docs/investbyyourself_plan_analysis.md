# 📊 InvestByYourself Plan Analysis & Integration

*Created: January 2025*

## 🔍 **Plan Comparison Analysis**

### **📋 What's Already Covered in Our Master Todo:**

#### **✅ Well Covered:**
- **CI/CD & Testing Infrastructure** - Our Tech-001 through Tech-005 cover this comprehensively
- **Project Structure** - Our reorganization and package structure is excellent
- **ETL Architecture** - Our Story-005 and Tech-008-010 provide detailed ETL planning
- **Database Design** - Our Tech-008 covers database infrastructure well

#### **🔄 Partially Covered:**
- **Market Data Collection** - We have basic structure but need more specific implementation
- **Portfolio Analysis** - Mentioned but not detailed in our plan
- **Backtesting Engine** - Not covered in our current plan

#### **❌ Missing from Our Plan:**
- **Local vs Web App Architecture Decision** - This is a critical strategic decision
- **Frontend Technology Choices** - We haven't specified UI/UX approach
- **Success Metrics & KPIs** - We have technical metrics but not business metrics
- **Phase 5 Future Expansion** - We focus on MVP, not long-term vision

- **Database schema design** lacks specific table structures
- **Error handling and monitoring** not detailed

### **2. Risk Management**
- **API rate limiting strategies** not specified
- **Data quality validation** approaches not detailed
- **Fallback mechanisms** for API failures

### **3. Testing Strategy**
- **No mention of testing approach** for each module
- **Performance testing** not covered
- **Security testing** not specified
